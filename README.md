# Pokédex-Navi(gator)

This is a web application designed to simplify Pokémon information lookups with a clean and intuitive UI. Users can easily browse Pokémon details, including abilities, stats, and types across different generations. The application provides a seamless and interactive experience for what is essentially a Pokédex.

## Motivations and Outcomes

This project serves as an evolution of skills that I have amassed while learning about web design and web development. Through this project, I was able to learn various web developement concepts such as:

- Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- Data Fetching through an API ([PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) in this case)
- The [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) Project Structure

## Future Plans

I would like to improve and expand this website, so that it can provide an intuitive and comprehensive experience for the Pokémon information lookup process. Since getting the information from the current Pokémon databases can be tedious, I would like this to be an alternative for the same.
